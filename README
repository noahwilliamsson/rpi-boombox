What?
=====
This is a simple jukebox application using libspotify.  It plays your "starred"
playlist by default.  It's possible to switch playlist and change the currently
playing track, but that's about it.

The program may be remotely controlled over the network or, if running on a
Raspberry Pi, via an external hardware button with a few extra components.


License
=======
This application uses a few pieces from the libspotify distribution:
audio.h, audio.c, openal-audio.c (slightly modified) which are MIT licensed.
queue.h which is 3-clause BSD licensed.

Everything else is licensed under a 2-clause BSD license.
http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause


Running
=======
You'll need a Spotify premium account in order to use this program.

The first time you need to enter credentials on the command line:
$ ./pi-boombox <username> <password>

On subsequent runs it is sufficient to just run:
$ ./pi-boombox

By default it will start to play tracks in your "starred" playlists.


A lot of stuff is logged to syslog and the console (stderr) by
default.  Feel free to reduce logging by updating the call to
setlogmask() in main.c (around line 280).


Offline mode
============
The application automatically marks the active playlist for offline usage.
This means that tracks in the starred playlist aswell as tracks in any
playlist submitted via the remote control interface will be synchronized
to local storage.


Building on Linux
=================
On Ubuntu or Raspbian, install necessary build tools using:
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libopenal-dev

Install libspotify under /usr:
$ curl -LO http://developer.spotify.com/download/libspotify/libspotify-12.1.103-Linux-armv6-bcm2708hardfp-release.tar.gz
$ tar zxf libspotify-12.1.103-Linux-armv6-bcm2708hardfp-release.tar.gz
$ cd libspotify-12.1.103-Linux-armv6-bcm2708hardfp-release
$ sudo make install prefix=/usr

Finally, run 'make' in the source folder:
$ make


Building on Mac OS X
====================
Make sure you've got Xcode installed

Install libspotify.framework under /Library/Frameworks
$ curl -LO http://developer.spotify.com/download/libspotify/libspotify-12.1.51-Darwin-universal.zip
$ unzip libspotify-12.1.51-Darwin-universal.zip
$ cd libspotify-12.1.51-Darwin-universal
$ tar c libspotify.framework | sudo tar xv -C /Library/Frameworks

Finally, run 'make' in the source folder:
$ make

(or open the Xcode project and build from there)


TCP based control interface
===========================
The program listens for incoming TCP connections on port 1234 which allows
for rudimentary remote control of the playback.

The list of supported commands is as follows:
  "next" (change to next track)
  "stop" (stop playback)
  "play" (restart playback)
  "logout" (logout and shutdown the program)

If a Spotify playlist URI is sent the program will set that playlist as
the active playlist.  Issue a "next" command to start playing from it
immediately.

Here's an example with Netcat (nc):
$ echo stop | nc 127.0.0.1 1234
# OK, stopping playback

$ echo play | nc 127.0.0.1 1234
# OK, starting playback

$ echo spotify:user:whatever:starred | nc 10.0.0.8 1234
# OK, playlist is now the active playlist

$ echo next | nc 127.0.0.1 1234
# OK, playing next track


To change the default listening port, edit net.h and update CTRL_TCP_PORT.
NOTE: It listens on all available interfaces (IPv4 address 0.0.0.0).


Raspberry Pi button to change tracks
====================================
On Raspberry Pi hardware a simple button may be connected to change tracks:

P1-11 (GPIO17) --> [10k ohm resistor] --> P1-01 (3.3V)
P1-11 (GPIO17) --> [BUTTON] --> [1k ohm resistor] --> P1-06 (GND)

For more details on the P1 header on Raspberry Pi, see:
http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals#General_Purpose_Input.2FOutput_.28GPIO.29

If you would like to use a different GPIO connector, edit rpi-gpio.h.

GPIO17 was selected because it's available on the same pin on both the rev.1
and rev.2 hardware of the Raspberry Pi.


Additionally, if you would like to power the Pi from a 4.8V battery, hook up
the battery to P1-02 (5V) and P1-06 (GND).  A 4.8V battery pack may be
constructed from four AA (R6) 1.2V NiMh batteries.  The model A draws half
the power (around 1.5W with no connected USB devices) compared to the model B.

The Pi seems to do fine with voltages in the USB +/- 5% range, i.e, 4.75-5.25V.
Avoid using regular 1.5V AA batteries as they exceed the Pi's operating voltage.


Raspberry Pi model A notes
==========================
Libspotify requires a network interface (ethX or wlanX) to be present or the
application won't start.

This can become a problem on the Raspberry Pi model A if you've had networking
hardware present at one point and later attempt to run the application without
it, hoping to play tracks that been made available offline.

This can be worked around by adding a virtual network interface with the same
MAC address as the previously attached network hardware:
$ sudo ip link add eth2 address <MAC address here> type bridge
